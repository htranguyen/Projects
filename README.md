## About me

Hey there! I'm Tra, currently on my journey to complete my MSc in Business Analytics at Babson College. My time here has been all about building a solid foundation in analytics and strategy, and I've got a real passion for using data to dig up those hidden insights.

During my studies, I've had the chance to dive deep into complex data, honing my knack for spotting patterns and trends. I've also gained practical experience in consulting, strategic finance, pricing strategies, data management, and statistical analysis, all of which I believe will prove invaluable in my endeavor to assist businesses in making well-informed, data-driven decisions.

This portfolio is my way of showcasing what I can do and keeping track of my journey in the data analytics field. Let's dive in! ðŸ˜„ðŸ“ŠðŸš€

## Project Details
<a name="houseprice"></a>
### Bikeshare Rider Volume Forecast
**Code:** [Bikeshare Rider Volume Forecast.R](https://github.com/tungble/Machine-Learning-in-R/blob/d700dc991641a42c4055539eb8a6e9b34d27cc4b/Bikeshare%20Rider%20Volume%20Forecast.R)

**Goals:** 
1. Determine what factors contribute the most to ridership volume
2. Forecast ridership volume

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of bikeshare ridership from January 2011 through December 2012. The dataset included season, holiday, workingday, weathear, temperature, humidity, windspeed, ridership type, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), performing multivariate analysis to analyze the correlation between external factors and ridership types, and forecasting rider volume using 4 ML algorithms: linear regression, regression tree, knn regression, and ensemble learning. 

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, multivariate analysis, hypothesis testing, machine learning, data visualization.

**Technology:** R, lubridate, caret, rpart, rpart.plot, Metrics.

**Results:** 

Using ML algorithms the analysis revealed that time is the strongest predictor of ridership, 

votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
