## About me

Hello ðŸ‘‹ I'm Tra. I currently completing MSc Business Analytics at Babson College. I have developed a strong foundation in analytics, strategy, and a passion for leveraging data to discover meaningful insights. 

During my studies, I honed my ability to work with complex data and developed a keen eye for identifying patterns and trends. I also gained experience in consulting, strategic finance and pricing, data management, and statistical analysis, which I believe will be valuable assets in my role in helping businesses make informed decisions backed by data.

I am excited to bring my technical and analytical skills to the domain of data analytics.

### Bikeshare Rider Volume Forecast
**Code:** [Bikeshare Rider Volume Forecast.R](https://github.com/tungble/Machine-Learning-in-R/blob/d700dc991641a42c4055539eb8a6e9b34d27cc4b/Bikeshare%20Rider%20Volume%20Forecast.R)

**Goals:** 
1. Determine what factors contribute the most to ridership volume
2. Forecast ridership volume

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of bikeshare ridership from January 2011 through December 2012. The dataset included season, holiday, workingday, weathear, temperature, humidity, windspeed, ridership type, and other relevant information. The project involved loading the data, cleaning and preprocessing it, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), performing multivariate analysis to analyze the correlation between external factors and ridership types, and forecasting rider volume using 4 ML algorithms: linear regression, regression tree, knn regression, and ensemble learning. 

**Skills:** data cleaning, data analysis, multivariate analysis, hypothesis testing, machine learning, data visualization.

**Technology:** R, lubridate, caret, rpart, rpart.plot, Metrics.

**Results:** 

Using ML algorithms the analysis revealed that time is the strongest predictor of ridership, 

votes and budget have the highest correlation with gross earnings, while the company has no significant correlation.
