## About me

Hey there! I'm Tra, currently on my journey to complete my MSc in Business Analytics at Babson College. My time here has been all about building a solid foundation in analytics and strategy, and I've got a real passion for using data to dig up those hidden insights.

During my studies, I've had the chance to dive deep into complex data, honing my knack for spotting patterns and trends. I've also gained practical experience in consulting, strategic finance, pricing strategies, data management, and statistical analysis, all of which I believe will prove invaluable in my endeavor to assist businesses in making well-informed, data-driven decisions.

This portfolio is my way of showcasing what I can do and keeping track of my journey in the data analytics field. Let's dive in! ðŸ˜„ðŸ“ŠðŸš€

## Project Details
<a name="houseprice"></a>
### 1. House Prices Prediction
**Code:** [House Prices Prediction.R](https://github.com/trahnguyen/Codes/blob/81feb2b02a4a77348dd95cd5b476ad96883389ab/House%20Price%20Prediction_Code.R)

**Goals:** 
1. Feature engineering
2. Predict house prices using advanced regression techniques and stacked models

**Description:** The project focused on analyzing a dataset of 79 explanatory variables describing every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. This project encompassed a comprehensive analysis of residential property data, involving data preparation, exploratory analysis, multivariate analysis, and machine learning to predict house prices accurately.
4 machine learning algorithms employed: linear regression, regression tree, neural networks, and ensemble learning.

**Skills:** data cleaning, feature engineering, data analysis, multivariate analysis, hypothesis testing, benchmarking, machine learning, data visualization.

**Results:** 
- I conducted data cleaning for improved model efficiency and accuracy, addressing "NAs" and unnecessary variables. This reduced mean absolute percentage errors for linear regression and regression tree models.
- The neural network model performed poorly with a high RMSE and MAPE.
- My ensemble model, combining linear regression, regression tree, and neural network, achieved the best RMSE and MAPE results, enhancing prediction accuracy.
